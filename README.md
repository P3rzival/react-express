# React - Express Template

After creating multiple react / express apps I've come tot he conslussion that it would be pretty useful to have a template to start working from with all the intial configuration I like already set up.

### The template comes with the following things already set:

- Create React App Client
- Simple Express Server 
- Proxy connection created
- Semantic-UI css working
- React Scripts Ejected (in order to be able to modify Jest Configuration)
- Components and Tests structure
- GitIgnore files set
- Yarn predominant use
- Express Connection Example Running
